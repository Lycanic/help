# Fragment Library 
This link will open in your default internet browser. Fragments contained in this library can be copied and pasted straight from the web into Olex2.

## Pasted fragments  
These will appear in a strange green colour, and you can then anchor them onto electron density peaks by first clicking on an atom in the imported fragment and then on the corresponding Q-peak. Repeat this progress with another atom/Q pair until a reasonable match is achieved.

## Exit matching mode  
Press `Esc` repeatedly, or press the `Esc` link in the orange mode box to get out of this matching mode.
