# Electron Density Peak Slider 
Electron Density Peak Slider Move the slider to the left to filter out strongest peaks first, or to the right to filter out weakest peaks first. You can then do things like `name $Q C` - and this will only apply to the currently visible peaks. The same goes for the 'Select' and 'Delete' buttons.
