The **Extension Modules** provide either functionality, or make commonly used tasks easier to use. We are currently working on number of these modules, and will make them available for testing as they are ready. You are welcome to test and use them, provided you agree to the following conditions:
  1. We take no responsibility for any modules that are in the test phase. Please use your own disgression and check everything carefully!
  2. Please tell us about bugs and suggest improvements
  3. Testing modules will be available for 30 days. After this period, you may get a new version of the module two more times (30 days each). After this period, you must contact us to continue using/testing the modules
  4. Some of these modules will not be available free of charge after the end of the testing phase.
